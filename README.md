
# **Project Documentation: Backend System**

## **Project Overview**

This backend project is built using Node.js and is designed to handle API requests for a variety of services. The system follows a modular structure with separate components for models, routes, and utilities. It also uses Swagger for API documentation, making it easy to understand and interact with the available endpoints.

## **Project Structure**

- **app.js**: This is the main entry point of the application, where the Express server is initialized, middleware is configured, and routes are set up.
- **helper/**: Contains utility functions to aid in various operations such as data validation, error handling, and other helper methods.
- **models/**: Contains the data models, defining the structure of the data stored in the database (likely using Mongoose for MongoDB).
- **node_modules/**: Contains all the external dependencies required by the project. This folder is automatically created by npm.
- **package.json**: Defines the metadata for the project, including dependencies, scripts, and other configuration.
- **package-lock.json**: Ensures the exact version of each installed dependency is locked for consistency.
- **public/**: A directory to serve static files such as images, CSS, or JavaScript to clients.
- **routers/**: This directory contains the route files for different parts of the application. Each file in this directory defines routes for a specific service.
- **swagger.js**: Configures Swagger to automatically generate and serve API documentation.
- **swagger-output.json**: Contains the generated Swagger documentation in JSON format.

## **Key Features**

1. **Modular Structure**: The project is organized into clear modules for better maintainability.
   - Routes are separated into different files in the **routers** directory.
   - Models define the data structure in the **models** directory.

2. **API Documentation**: Swagger is integrated into the project, and the generated API documentation is available through the Swagger UI. This allows developers to easily see all available endpoints, their descriptions, and expected inputs/outputs.

3. **Environment Variables**: The project uses a `.env` file for storing environment-specific variables such as database credentials, API keys, etc.

4. **Database Models**: The **models** directory contains the schema for various resources, which are used to interact with the database (most likely MongoDB).

5. **Error Handling**: Helper functions for consistent error responses across the project.

## **Setup Instructions**

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v12 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (if used as the database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define necessary environment variables. Example:

   ```
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (default).

### API Documentation
- The API documentation is automatically generated using Swagger. To view it, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`.

## **Common Commands**

- **Start the development server**: `npm start`
- **Run tests**: `npm test`
- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
- **Generate Swagger documentation**: The documentation is automatically generated on server start.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Add authentication (JWT or OAuth) for secure access to certain routes.
- Implement more comprehensive logging using Winston or similar libraries.
- Add caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- Expand the API documentation with more details about the endpoints and usage.
